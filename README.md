## üë• Team Roles

### 1. Business Analyst (BA)
- **Responsibilities**: Understands customer business processes and translates them into actionable requirements. A BA analyzes stakeholder feedback, defines workflows, and bridges the gap between the customer and the development team, ensuring the product aligns with the customer's vision.
- **Key Tasks**: Gather requirements, model workflows, align product development with business needs.

### 2. Product Owner (PO)
- **Responsibilities**: Holds the responsibility for the product vision and its evolution. The PO ensures the product meets customer requirements, balancing business needs and market trends. The PO manages the product backlog and defines the product strategy.
- **Key Tasks**: Shape the product vision, prioritize features, and ensure the product meets customer expectations.

### 3. Project Manager (PM)
- **Responsibilities**: Manages project timelines, tasks, and resources. The PM ensures the product is delivered on time and within budget, maintaining transparency and communication within the team and stakeholders. In Agile environments, the PM ensures the team delivers more value with each iteration.
- **Key Tasks**: Plan work activities, distribute tasks, and ensure project milestones are met.

### 4. UI/UX Designer
- **Responsibilities**: Transforms the product vision into user-friendly designs. The UI/UX designer focuses on user experience and interface design, ensuring the product is intuitive, engaging, and user-friendly.
- **Key Tasks**: User research, persona development, wireframing, prototyping, and creating intuitive interfaces.

### 5. Software Architect
- **Responsibilities**: Designs the high-level software architecture and selects appropriate tools and platforms to implement the product vision. Ensures code quality standards and oversees code reviews to maintain software stability.
- **Key Tasks**: Define system architecture, make high-level design decisions, and set up code quality processes.

### 6. Software Developer
- **Responsibilities**: Engineers and stabilizes the product by coding the application. Software developers can specialize in front-end (user-facing features) or back-end (business logic and database interactions), and full-stack developers handle both.
- **Key Tasks**: Write code, implement algorithms, develop integrations, and ensure a smooth user experience.

### 7. Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer
- **Responsibilities**: Ensures the product meets functional and non-functional requirements by performing various tests. QA engineers analyze test results, report on application quality, and ensure that the product is defect-free and performs as expected.
- **Key Tasks**: Conduct functional, usability, security, and performance testing, document results, and ensure product quality.

### 8. Test Automation Engineer
- **Responsibilities**: Designs and maintains a test automation ecosystem, writing test scripts for automated testing. The goal is to improve testing speed and reliability by automating repetitive tasks and enabling continuous feedback on application quality.
- **Key Tasks**: Develop automated tests, choose suitable parts for automation, and maintain the test environment.

### 9. DevOps Engineer
- **Responsibilities**: Facilitates cooperation between development and operations teams. DevOps engineers build and maintain continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline the software delivery process and ensure fast, reliable releases.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

Our Airbnb Clone backend is built with a robust and scalable technology stack to ensure performance, security, and maintainability.

### 1. **Django**
   - **Purpose**: A high-level Python web framework used to build the core backend of the application. It provides a clean and maintainable structure for web applications and supports rapid development with built-in features like authentication, database management, and security.

### 2. **Django REST Framework (DRF)**
   - **Purpose**: A powerful toolkit for building RESTful APIs in Django. DRF simplifies API development by providing authentication, serialization, and request handling out of the box.

### 3. **GraphQL**
   - **Purpose**: A query language that provides a flexible and efficient way to retrieve and manipulate data from the backend. It allows clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues.

### 4. **PostgreSQL**
   - **Purpose**: A powerful, open-source relational database used to store structured data such as user profiles, property listings, bookings, and payments. PostgreSQL ensures high performance and scalability.

### 5. **Celery**
   - **Purpose**: A task queue used for handling asynchronous background tasks. It is essential for processing time-consuming operations like sending notifications, handling large-scale database operations, and managing scheduled tasks.

### 6. **Redis**
   - **Purpose**: An in-memory key-value store used for caching and session management. It helps speed up database queries and improves overall system performance.

### 7. **Docker**
   - **Purpose**: A containerization tool that ensures the application runs in a consistent environment across different systems. It helps streamline development, testing, and deployment.

### 8. **CI/CD Pipelines**
   - **Purpose**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing and deploying code changes. This ensures smooth and efficient software delivery.
